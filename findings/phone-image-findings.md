# Phone Image Analysis

## 1. Summary of Findings
The mobile phone identified as **Samsung SM-J330FN** was analyzed using
**Autopsy v4.22.1**. The purpose of this examination was to collect digital
evidence related to the suspect Roger and his younger brother Jimmy, and
to reconstruct a timeline of actions leading up to Roger’s arrest.

The analysis of the mobile forensic image revealed multiple artifacts that
significantly clarify the sequence of events and demonstrate coercion,
communication, and coordination related to the kidnapping and subsequent
criminal activity.

## 2. Detailed Analysis

### 2.1 SMS / Message Evidence
Examination of SMS data revealed regular communication between Jimmy and
Roger prior to the kidnapping. Following Jimmy’s abduction, the kidnapper
used Jimmy’s phone to communicate directly with Roger.

#### Key Message Highlights
- Confirmation of Roger’s identity as Jimmy’s brother
- Statements indicating Jimmy owed money and was being held hostage
- Explicit threats, including:
  - “Your brother is already struggling to breathe.”
  - “We are not letting him go unless we get what we want.”
  - “If you involve the police, you will see your brother feed the fishes.”
- A ransom demand of **USD 250,000**
- Instructions ordering Roger to wait at home for further directions
- Follow-up messages such as:
  - “Cars are dropped.”
  - “Roger! Call me.”
  - “Where is he?”
  - “Good job. You will see your brother soon.”

#### Conclusion of SMS Analysis
The SMS evidence clearly indicates that Roger was acting under extreme
pressure. The kidnapper’s use of Jimmy’s phone provided direct control and
real-time instructions, strongly supporting the theory of coercion.

### 2.2 Discord Evidence
Artifacts recovered from the directory:
/data/com.discord/cache
contained cached images and fragmented text related to Discord
communications.

#### Discord Chat Artifacts
Keyword searches revealed references to Discord accounts including:
- **ZeroFrequency**
- **Roger_the_mechanic**
- **JayTheDude**

Recovered text fragments included:
- “Yeah, I will help if you need it too.”
- “48h for 250k.”
- “I am afraid to do that. They said he will disappear if I do.”
- “There were pictures of Jimmy on the pendrive.”
- “Did you find out more about Jimmy?? Wtf.”
- “Shit man, don’t involve the police.”

#### Conclusion of Discord Analysis
The Discord artifacts confirm that multiple individuals were coordinating
with Roger regarding the ransom, Jimmy’s condition, and evidence stored on
a USB device. This demonstrates organized collaboration beyond a single
actor.

## 3. Image and Metadata Evidence
Multiple images were recovered from the phone, providing strong contextual
and corroborative evidence.

### 3.1 Images of Jimmy
Images depicting Jimmy with tied hands, blindfolded, and visible blood
strongly support the claim that he was kidnapped and physically abused.

### 3.2 Vehicle Images
The phone contained images of **three luxury vehicles**, consistent with
the kidnapper’s demand and supporting the allegation that Roger was forced
to steal specific cars.

### 3.3 Envelope Image
An image of a torn envelope labeled with Roger’s name was recovered. The
envelope contained a USB device, directly supporting SMS references to a
pendrive used for communication and intimidation.

## 4. Geolocation Evidence
Several images contained GPS metadata with approximate coordinates:
- **Latitude:** ~55.94
- **Longitude:** between -3.20 and -3.26

These coordinates correspond to **Edinburgh, United Kingdom**. Additional
artifacts included:
- A Google Maps screenshot showing locations such as Ferry Road, Portland
  Street, Commercial Street, and Ocean Terminal
- Discord messages referencing the location **“Heriot Row”**

The metadata and communication artifacts collectively indicate consistent
presence and activity within Edinburgh.

## 5. Conclusion
The phone image analysis provides strong and consistent evidence that:
1. Jimmy was kidnapped, as confirmed by images and SMS communications.
2. Roger was in active communication with the kidnapper via Jimmy’s phone.
3. Multiple individuals coordinated through Discord, including
   ZeroFrequency and JayTheDude.
4. Tools potentially used in the crime (e.g., jammers, signal and Wi-Fi
   toolkits) were referenced in Discord-related images.
5. Images of three luxury cars align directly with the kidnapper’s demands.

Overall, the mobile forensic evidence strongly supports the conclusion that
Roger’s actions were driven by coercion resulting from Jimmy’s kidnapping.
