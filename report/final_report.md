# Final Report and Conclusion

## Case Overview
This investigation analyzed digital forensic evidence obtained from a
Windows computer, an Android mobile phone, and a USB storage device
belonging to Roger, a suspect in a series of luxury car thefts.

The objective was to identify communication methods, data concealment
techniques, and the role of coercion related to the kidnapping of
Roger’s younger brother, Jimmy.

## Summary of Key Findings
The forensic analysis revealed:
- SMS communications confirming Jimmy’s kidnapping and ransom demands
- Use of Jimmy’s phone by the kidnapper to issue real-time threats and
  instructions
- Discord communications involving multiple individuals coordinating
  activities
- Use of steganography to hide images and messages inside PDF files
- Presence of a steganography tool (`steghide.exe`) on Roger’s Windows
  system
- Concealment of luxury car images among benign food images
- Reliance on web-based email services to reduce local forensic traces

---

## Evidence Correlation
The findings across all three forensic images were consistent and
mutually reinforcing. Artifacts recovered from the USB device directly
aligned with tools and behaviors observed on the Windows system, while
mobile device communications confirmed coercion and intent.

This cross-device correlation strengthens the reliability of the
conclusions.

## Conclusion
The digital evidence strongly supports the conclusion that:
- Jimmy was kidnapped and used as leverage
- Roger’s actions were performed under coercion and direct threat
- Multiple communication platforms were used to coordinate the criminal
  activity
- Steganography and web-based services were deliberately used to conceal
  evidence

Overall, the investigation demonstrates that Roger’s involvement in the
luxury car thefts was not voluntary but was the result of sustained
intimidation and coercion by the kidnapper.

## Limitations
- Full message content from web-based email services could not be
  recovered due to server-side storage
- Some artifacts were partially deleted or recovered from unallocated
  space

Despite these limitations, sufficient corroborating evidence was
identified to support the investigation’s conclusions.
