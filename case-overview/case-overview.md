# Case Summary

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to collect and correlate digital evidence
related to the suspect’s communication, coordination, and data concealment
across multiple platforms, including Discord, email, SMS, and encrypted or
steganographic files.

The analysis of multiple forensic images provided sufficient evidence of
both online and local communication methods used by the suspect.

## Android Mobile Image Findings
Analysis of the Android mobile forensic image revealed that Roger was in
continuous communication with the kidnapper via SMS using Jimmy’s phone.
This indicates active coordination between Roger and the kidnapper.

The phone also contained:
- Images of Jimmy received via a USB device, suggesting proof-of-life
- Photographs of three luxury cars
- An image of a torn envelope labeled with Roger’s name containing a USB device

These findings support the theory of intimidation and forced cooperation.
Additionally, Discord artifacts were identified, indicating that Roger was
seeking assistance to carry out luxury car thefts and deliver them to the
kidnapper.

## USB Storage Device Findings
Analysis of the USB storage device uncovered several suspicious artifacts,
including invoice files containing hidden data, indicating the use of
steganography.

Additional evidence included:
- A threat note from the kidnapper demanding either USD 250,000 or the
  delivery of three luxury cars
- Images showing Jimmy being held hostage, providing strong evidence of
  kidnapping and coercion

These findings demonstrate the use of removable media for covert
communication and intimidation.

## Windows Image Findings
Analysis of the Windows forensic image revealed significant evidence,
including:
- Images of luxury cars linked to the theft operation
- Repeated use of web-based email services
- Access to suspicious online file conversion tools such as freeconvert.com
- Presence of steganography-related tools

A password-protected archive named `food.zip` was identified. The extracted
folder contained files with patterned naming conventions:
- Numerically named files containing images of cars
- Decimal-named files containing images of food

This pattern suggests deliberate concealment of illicit content among
benign-looking files.

## Conclusion
The evidence collected from the Android mobile image, USB storage device,
and Windows system collectively supports the allegation that Roger
participated in the luxury car thefts under coercion.

The findings demonstrate:
- Use of multiple communication platforms
- Application of data concealment techniques such as encryption and
  steganography
- Continuous coordination with the kidnapper using Jimmy as leverage

Overall, the digital evidence strongly supports the theory of forced
criminal activity driven by the kidnapping of Jimmy.
